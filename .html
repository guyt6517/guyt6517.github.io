    <h3>What is HuskAPI?</h3>
    <p>HuskAPI is a API service that works as a deterent for Roblox Erotic Role Players (ERPers).</p>
    <p>HuskAPI stands for Horny User Scanner Kicker, it is a growing database of User IDs that have joined a Sting Operation that logs the joining user's ID.</p>
    <p>Roblox's moderation team is uneffective due to a lack of staff and knowledge on slang. HuskAPI gives users a option to join a game they believe is a condo, if they do then they are added to the database.</p>
    <p>If a user that joins a game using HuskAPI they are kicked from the game.</p> 

    <h3>What users will be added to HuskAPI?</h3>
    <p>Users who are found through three different sources will be added to the HuskAPI</p>
    <p>  1. Users who have joined a game disguised as a condo</p>
    <p>  2. Usernames scraped from condo community subreddits</p>
    <p>  3. Users who are spotted and reported to the HuskAPI for engaging in indecent activities</p>
